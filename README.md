![Overview](examples/overview.png)

OFA is a unified multimodal pretrained model that unifies modalities (i.e., cross-modality, vision, language) and tasks 
(e.g., image generation, visual grounding, image captioning, image classification, text generation, etc.) 
to a simple sequence-to-sequence learning framework. For more information, please refer to our paper: [Unifying Architectures, Tasks, and Modalities Through a Simple Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03052).

# Finetuning & Inference
Below we provide methods for finetuning and inference on different downstream tasks.
## Image Captioning
1. Download data (see [datasets.md](datasets.md)) and models (see [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md)) and put them in the correct directory
2. Train
```bash
cd run_scripts/caption
nohup sh train_caption_stage1.sh > train_stage1.out &  # stage1, train with cross-entropy loss
nohup sh train_caption_stage2.sh > train_stage2.out &  # stage2, load the best ckpt of stage1 and train with CIDEr optimization 
```
3. Inference
```bash
cd run_scripts/caption ; sh evaluate_caption.sh  # inference & evaluate
```

## Referring Expression Comprehension 
1. Download data (see [datasets.md](datasets.md)) and models (see [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md)) and put them in the correct directory
2. Train
```bash
cd run_scripts/refcoco
nohup sh train_refcoco.sh > train_refcoco.out &  # finetune for refcoco
nohup sh train_refcocoplus.sh > train_refcocoplus.out &  # finetune for refcoco+
nohup sh train_refcocog.sh > train_refcocog.out &  # finetune for refcocog
```
3. Inference
```bash
cd run_scripts/refcoco ; sh evaluate_refcoco.sh  # inference & evaluate for refcoco/refcoco+/refcocog
```

## Visual Question Answering
Here we provide the finetuning and inference codes to easily reproduce the VQAv2 result reported in our paper (**test-std 80.02**). We believe much improvement on accuracy can still be achieved based on this codebase :)
1. **Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints**: Download data (see [datasets.md](datasets.md)) and models (see [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md)) and put them in the correct directory. The dataset zipfile `vqa_data.zip` is around 100G and the decompressed data costs around 135G disk storage, which contains the training, validation and testing samples together with other necessary data resources. Following common practice, VG-QA samples are also included in the training data. To adapt to the seq2seq paradigm of OFA, we transform original VQA training questions with multiple golden answers into multiple training samples. Each line of the dataset represents a VQA sample with the following format. The information of question-id, image-id, question, answer (with confidence), predicted object labels  (taken from [VinVL](https://github.com/pzzhang/VinVL), slightly improve the performance), image base64 string are separated by tabs.

    ```
2. **Shuffle the Training Data** (optional, but achieves better finetuning accuracy): If the disk storage is sufficient, we recommend to prepare the shuffled training data for each epoch in advance. In our experiments, we use shuffling which brings around **+0.3** improvement on VQA accuracy.
    ```
    cd dataset/vqa_data
    ln vqa_train.tsv vqa_train_1.tsv
    for idx in `seq 1 9`;do shuf vqa_train_${idx}.tsv > vqa_train_$[${idx}+1].tsv;done # each file is used for an epoch
    ```
3. **Finetuning**: In our experiments, the VQA finetuning is performed on 4 8-A100-GPU servers. Here provide the finetuning script `train_vqa_distributed.sh` which supports distributed training (as well as single-server training). Please refer to the comments in the beginning of the script and set the configs correctly according to your distribution environment. If you have shuffled the training data in the previous step, please correctly specify the training data path following the guide in the script comments. **The command should be run on each worker.** 
    ```
    # run on each worker after the distributed and data configs has been correctly set following the guide in train_vqa_distributed.sh 
    cd run_scripts/vqa
    bash train_vqa_distributed.sh 
    ```
